 <tr>
 <th> Virus </th>
 <td> A pice of code that injects itself into its host and uses it to replicate itself and spread further. If a virus gets onto one computor, it can spread hugely and control all infected computors. </td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr>
 <th> DDoS </th>
 <td> Distributed Denial of Service. To DDOS someone, you overload a website usually using a bot net of computors hacked with a virus. </td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr>
 <th> Bot Net</th>
 <td> A network of hacked computors that can be used as huge netwoorks to DDOS and send spam to other comptors. These usually run a programm.</td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr>
 <th> Anti-Virus </th>
 <td> A program that looks for suspicious code or compares code to known examples. It is essential to have an antivirus installed, though they are not completely failsafe. </td>
 </tr>


 <tr>
 <th> Password Security </th>
 <td> The simple username and password authentication method. This is better than no security at all, but not the best by far. If the data is sent unencripted, the method is even less secure as any computor between the two computors can see the username and password. </td>
 </tr>
 
 <tr>
 <th> 2FA </th>
 <td> Two Factor Authentication. This is where two people have the same 'key' that encodes the current time. The two keys make the same code at the same kind and hte generated code can be used in addition to password security. </td>
 </tr>
