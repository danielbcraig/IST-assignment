<dl>
	<dt> HTML </dt>
	<dd> HyperText Markup Language. This is the base of the web. HTML is the programming language that tells almost websites what to display. HTML is made up of different primaraly of different tags containing data.</dd> <br>
	
	<dt> HTTP / HTTPS</dt>
	<dd> HyperText Transfer Protocall (Secure). HTTP is the language that computors use to communicate with each other over the internet. It is made up mostly of GET requests which usually send the website in plain text.</dd> <br>
	<dd> HTTPS is what is used when things need to be secure. The extra'S' means that either SSL TLS are being used, which means that the connection is secure </dd> <br>

	<dt> GET Request</dt>
	<dd> GET requests make up most of HTTP(S). It is a simple request to download a file such as an HTML document from a server. eg. GET document-name  HTTP/1.1 Host: website-name. </dd> <br>

	<dt> POST Request </dt>
	<dd> This is very much like a GET request, except instead of asking for information from a server, you are sending it. This is used for things like submitting passwords or even for telling google what you are asking </dd> <br>
	
	<dt> Web Server </dt>
	<dd> A web server is a computor that is connected to the internet, that hosts a website or websites. When you access a website, you are actually downloading it from a sever. The language that is used to communicate between your computor and a server is HTTP. </dd> <br>
	
	<dt> Browser <dt>
	<dd> The program on your computor that you use to browse the internet. It accesses websites by comminication with severs and then displays the what the code tells it to. </dd> <br>
	
	<dt> Port 80 </dt>
	<dd> port 80 is the port assigned to HTTP. This means that port 80 is the port that your computor uses to comminicate with the internet most of the time, although it is not hugely secure.</dd> <br>
	
	<dt> Port 443</dt>
	<dd> Port 443 is the port assighed to HTTPS. It does exactly the same thing, execpt it also incorperates SSL, secure sockets layer, to encrypt data to and from your computor.</dd> <br>
