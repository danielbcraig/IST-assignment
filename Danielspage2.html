<h2> TCP </h2>
<p> Transport control protocol. This protocal checks incoming packets for any errors and puts them together so the computor can make sence of it. </p>

<h2> Router </h2>
<p> Routers send and receive information from the internet. When going from one place on the internet to another, information must go through multiple routers which all send it in the general direction it needs to go. </p>

<h2> Fault Tolerant </h2>
<p> To be fault tolerant means to be able to deal with faults in what has been received and still work. Usually, digital systems are far more fault tolerant than analog systems. </p>

<h2> Scalable </h2>
<p> A system that can be used with both very few things and very many things is scalable. A multiplayer game that used computing power from all computors online would be extremely scalable </p>

<h2> Firewall </h2>
<p> A firewall locks down, and prevents programs opening certain ports. This makes your computor far more secure and much harder to hack. </p>

<h2> Packet </h2>
<p> Packets are what actually travels through the internet from one computor to another. They are made up of two main parts, the header and the payload</p>

<h2> header </h2>
<p> The header is the part of a a packet that tells routers where to send it. It is like the address on an envelope. </p>

<h2> Payload </h2>
<p> The part of a packet that actually has the information you want. This is like the actual letter inside an envelope. </p>

<h2> Port </h2>
<p> A chanel for information to go into or out of a computor. Different numbers are assigned to different purposes, eg. Email, SSH, etc.</p>
