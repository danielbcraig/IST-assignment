<table>
	<tr>
	<th> Domain Name:</th>
	<td> The domain name is the name of a website. Because IP addresses are hard to remember, the domain name system was made to direct people to the correct IP address when the name is entered as the URL</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
	<th> Cookie: </th>
	<td> This is extra data that servers send with websites that identifies a computor the next time it connects. One use for this is remembering a user after they log in so that they don't have to re-enter their password and username every time they access the website on the same device</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
	<th> Packet Switching: </th>	
	<td> Packet Switching is when data is broken up into smaller 'packets' before being sent to another computor. The data is then reassembled by the recieving computor to reform the complete set of data.</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
	<th> Hypertext: </th>
	<td> Hypertext is any text that is linked to other text. Hypertext can also be any image that links to another text. Without hypertext, you could not simpily click on a link to go to another website. </td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
	<th> URL: </th>
	<td> Uniform Resource Locator. This takes a domain name and points you to an IP address. Any website on the world wide web has a URL. </td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
	<th> ASCII: </th>
	<td> American Standard Code for Information Interchange. This is the standard encoding fot a plain text file. Each character is represented by a 7 bit binary number. There are 127 possible characters in standard ASCII and 255 in extended ACSII. </td>	
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
	<th> FTP: </th>
	<td> FIle Transfer Protocall. This one of the most important protocalls in internet communnication. It is what takes apart and puts together bits of data before and after being sent over the internet. Without TCP, all data recieved would be mixed up and wrong.  </td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>
	<th> SMTP:</th>
	<td> Simple Mail Transfer Protocall. This is by far the most commonly used protocall for sending Emails. Although it is very old, there is still no viable alternitive as the protocall still works well by today's standards. The standard port for SMTP comminication is port 25. </td>
